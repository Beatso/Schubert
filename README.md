This is a discord bot which gives users a role when they are in a voice channel. It can be configured as a role for a whole guild, or per-channel.


## Usage

To configure a voice channel role, type `^vcrole @role [voice-channel-id]`. you can also use the role ID. If `voice-channel-id` is omitted, the role will be for all voice channels in the server.

To clear a voice channel role type `^vcrole clear [voice-channel-id]`. If `voice-channel-id` is omitted, the role will be for all voice channels in the server.

If you ever need a link back to this page, use the command `^help`.
