this is a discord bot which gives users a role when they are in a voice channel. it can be configured as a role for a whole guild, or per-channel.


## usage

to clear a voice channel role type `^vcrole clear [voice-channel-id]`. if `voice-channel-id` is omitted, the role will be for all voice channels in the server.
